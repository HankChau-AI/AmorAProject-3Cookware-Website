The website's responsiveness is very smooth overall, except for the footer and the New Arrivals section. The footer remains responsive until it reaches mobile, where it starts to break, and the New Arrivals images become too squished on smaller screens. Aside from these issues, everything else looks great. The code is clean, well-organized, and easy to follow. Well done!
